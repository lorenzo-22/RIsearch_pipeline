"""siOFF must pin `penalty` explicitly rather than inherit upstream's default.

Inheriting it is exactly how a pin bump silently changed our numbers once:
`penalty` defaulted to 3.5 in risearch 0.0.0a1 and 0.0 in 3.0.0a2, and siOFF
never passed it, so bumping the pin moved E_min from -40.2956 to -33.2956
without a line of siOFF changing.

Pinning it means a future upstream default change is a no-op for us, and any
deliberate change is a visible diff in this repo. See saiden89/risearch#27 for
why the parameter is not comparable across versions anyway (units, sign and
effect on the reported energy all differ).
